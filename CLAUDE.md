# CLAUDE.md — BioPrecision Autonomous Agent Context

> Read this file at the start of every session. It is the single source of truth for the current state of BioPrecision. Update it at the end of every session with what changed.

## Standing Instructions

You are the autonomous engineering agent for BioPrecision. Dan Bricker is the founder. Your job is to build, debug, and ship — not to ask for permission on implementation decisions. Make the best call, document it here, push to main.

- **Push all changes directly to `main`** via the GitHub token in session
- **Never ask Dan to copy-paste code** — you write it, you push it
- **Never ask for clarification on obvious implementation details** — make a decision and note it in the changelog at the bottom of this file
- **If something is broken**, fix it before moving to new features
- **If you're unsure about product direction**, check the "Product North Star" section below before asking Dan

## Product North Star

**What BioPrecision is:**
An AI health intelligence platform that takes panel biomarkers and gives users daily ranked actions to fix what's insufficient. Think WHOOP — but the input is lab panels, not wearable signals. The output is daily accountability actions tied to specific deficient biomarkers, not strain/recovery scores.

**The core loop:**
1. Patient uploads labs → Agent 1 parses every biomarker
2. Agent 2 generates 5 ranked daily actions tied to out-of-range markers
3. Patient checks off actions daily (accountability loop)
4. Agent 3 (coach) knows exactly what they're working on, answers questions with their data
5. Repeat at next lab panel → show delta

**Beachhead customer:** Frame Longevity clinic patients (Dan's own clinic). ~$45K average annual revenue per enrolled patient. Clinical use case first, then DTC.

**Differentiator vs WHOOP:** WHOOP = wearable signals → recovery scores. BioPrecision = lab biomarkers → clinical protocol actions. WHOOP has no longitudinal lab accountability loop — that's the white space.

**What "done well" looks like:**
- Lab → protocol output: something Dan would hand to a Frame Longevity patient without editing
- Daily actions: specific, mechanism-cited, effect-size quantified, tied to actual values (not generic)
- Coach: responds like a clinician who has reviewed the full chart, not a chatbot

## Architecture

### Stack
- **Web app:** Next.js 16, TypeScript, Tailwind, deployed on Vercel
- **Mobile app:** Expo / React Native (in `/mobile` directory)
- **AI:** Anthropic API (`claude-opus-4-5` for agents, `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` for action ranking)
- **State:** Zustand (web), Zustand + AsyncStorage (mobile)
- **Database:** None yet — all in-memory. Supabase is the planned addition.

### The Three Agents

**Agent 1 — Lab Intelligence** (`src/app/api/parse-labs/route.ts`)
- Input: PDF or CSV lab file (multipart form)
- Process: Claude vision extracts all biomarkers, assigns functional medicine optimal ranges
- Output: `LabPanel` object with all biomarkers + status
- Model: `claude-opus-4-5` (vision needed for PDFs)
- Status: ✅ Built, deployed

**Agent 2 — Daily Actions** (`src/app/api/generate-actions/route.ts`)
- Input: `LabPanel`, optional `WearableData`, `goals[]`, `patientName`
- Process: Ranks candidate actions from clinical knowledge base, uses Claude to select/personalize top 5
- Output: 5 `HealthAction[]` ranked by clinical impact, specific to patient values
- Model: `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`
- Status: ✅ Built, deployed
- Trigger: Auto-fires from `useHealthStore.setLabPanel()`

**Agent 3 — Coach** (`src/app/api/chat/route.ts`)
- Input: `messages[]`, `labPanel`, `wearableData`, `intakeProfile`, `todaysActions`
- Process: Builds full clinical system prompt with patient data + today's action context
- Output: SSE streaming response
- Model: `claude-opus-4-5`
- Status: ✅ Built, deployed
- Key upgrade: Now receives `todaysActions` — knows exactly what patient is working on

## Onboarding Flow (Mobile, 8 Steps)

| Step | Component | Collects | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `StepGoals` | Name, multi-goal select | ✅ |
| 1 | `StepHealthFocus` | Primary focus (single), secondary goals | ✅ |
| 2 | `StepBiometrics` | Age, sex, height, weight | ✅ |
| 3 | `StepHabits` | Sleep, exercise, diet, stress, alcohol | ✅ |
| 4 | `StepSymptoms` | 10-symptom multi-select + free text | ✅ |
| 5 | `StepLabs` | Upload / demo / skip | ✅ |
| 6 | `StepWearables` | Device connect (Oura/WHOOP/Garmin/skip) | ✅ |
| 7 | `StepSummary` | AI intake summary using full profile | ✅ |

**Daily accountability loop** (`mobile/lib/DailyCheckIn.tsx`):
- Morning: check off yesterday's 5 actions (y/n)
- Rate sleep quality, energy, stress (1-5)
- Correlates completions to biomarker outcomes over time
- Status: ✅ Component built, not yet wired to home tab trigger

## Open Tasks (Priority Order)

### 🔴 Critical (blocks clinical use)
1. **Wire DailyCheckIn to home tab** — should appear as morning modal when app opens, after first day of use. Trigger: `lastCheckInDate !== today`. Store log in Zustand + AsyncStorage.
2. **Supabase integration** — persistent patient data across sessions. Tables needed: `patients`, `lab_panels`, `daily_logs`, `actions`. Without this, Frame Longevity can't use it clinically.
3. **Vercel env vars** — confirm `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set in Vercel dashboard. Agent 1/2/3 will fail in production without it.

### 🟡 High value (next sprint)
4. **Weekly progress summary** — Sunday auto-message from Agent 3: "Here's what moved this week and what to focus on next." Triggered by cron or on app open Sunday.
5. **Real wearable API connections** — Oura and WHOOP APIs. Current data is mock. Oura has a free REST API; WHOOP requires OAuth.
6. **Lab delta tracking** — when patient uploads second panel, show which biomarkers moved and by how much. "Your glucose dropped from 102 → 94 — the post-meal walks are working."

### 🟢 Good to have
7. **Frame Longevity clinician view** — read-only dashboard showing all enrolled patients, their latest panels, action completion rates. This is the B2B product.
8. **Push notifications** — morning check-in reminder, evening action nudge.
9. **PDF report generation** — exportable summary Dan can hand to patients or include in chart.

## Key Decisions Made

- **No app needed to make money** — service-first approach. Frame Longevity is paying customer, product gets validated clinically before DTC.
- **Functional medicine ranges, not lab ranges** — optimal ranges in `BIOMARKER_META` are set to functional medicine standards (e.g., glucose 70-99 not 70-125), which is Dan's clinical philosophy.
- **5 actions per day max** — deliberate constraint. More = overwhelm = no completion. Quality over quantity.
- **Mechanism + effect size required on every action** — generic actions ("eat better") are explicitly prohibited in Agent 2 prompt. Every action must cite the biological mechanism and expected effect size.
- **claude-opus-4-5 for lab parsing and coaching, sonnet for action ranking** — opus needed for PDF vision and clinical reasoning depth; sonnet is fast enough for action selection.
- **Mobile store (Zustand) generates actions locally** — mobile app has its own `generateActionsFromPanel()` in `mobile/lib/biomarkers.ts` so it works offline. Web app hits the API.

## Biomarker Coverage

Currently supported with full clinical context (mechanism, ranges, interventions, goal relevance):
`glucose`, `hba1c`, `totalCholesterol`, `ldl`, `hdl`, `triglycerides`, `hscrp`, `vitaminD`, `testosterone`, `cortisol`, `ferritin`, `tsh`

Agents will handle any biomarker in a lab panel but only the above have deep clinical metadata. New biomarkers should be added to `BIOMARKER_META` in `src/app/api/chat/route.ts` and `BIOMARKER_ACTIONS` in `src/app/api/generate-actions/route.ts`.
